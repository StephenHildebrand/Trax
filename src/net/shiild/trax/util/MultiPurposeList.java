/**
 * A generic class that supports the underlying list operations for the movie
 * inventory, reserve queues, and at-home queues. T is determined when the class
 * is instantiated as a Thing in the case of this project). Instantiation of the
 * class occurs in three places:
 * (1) ThingDB.movies
 * (2) Client.atHomeQueue
 * (3) Client.reserveQueue.
 *
 * Most of the MultiPurposeList methods are strictly position based, where the
 * position of the first element is 0, the second is 1, and so on. In the metheod
 * descriptions below, the int parameter is the given position.
 * None of the methods throw exceptions.
 *
 * MultiPurposeList uses a nested class named Node for its implementation. It
 * has two Node type data members: head, which points to the front of the list,
 * and iterator, which can traverse through the list elements. You can think of
 * an iterator as a cursor to the list, pointing to the "next" element to be
 * visited.
